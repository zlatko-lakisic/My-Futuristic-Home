# 🎮 Network Controller: Beelink EQ14

## **Overview**
The Network Controller manages the UniFi ecosystem and serves as the primary ingress point for the local network. It is hosted on a Beelink EQ14 to take advantage of dual physical Gigabit NICs, allowing the controller to exist on two subnets simultaneously.

## **Hardware Specifications**
- **Model:** Beelink EQ14
- **CPU:** Intel Processor N150 (Efficient Quad-Core)
- **Networking:** Dual Realtek 1GbE NICs (`10.0.10.6` / `192.168.89.6`)

## **Multi-Homed Networking Logic**
| Interface | Connection | IP Address | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NIC 1 (eth0)** | Perimeter Switch | `10.0.10.6` | Web UI Access & Secure Ingress |
| **NIC 2 (eth1)** | House LAN Switch | `192.168.89.6` | UniFi Inform Port (L2 Discovery) |

## **Software Stack (Docker)**
The Beelink runs a critical management stack. Beyond the [UniFi Controller](../infrastructure/unifi.md), it hosts the network's Edge Proxy.

### **Traefik Edge Proxy**
Traefik acts as the reverse proxy for all services. It handles Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates and routes traffic based on subdomains.
- **Entrypoints:** HTTP (:80), HTTPS (:443), IMAPS (:993), and SMTPS (:587).
- **Dashboard:** Secured and accessible only via the Perimeter IP at `10.0.10.6:8080`.
- **Dynamic Config:** Monitored via `/etc/traefik/dynamic` for hot-reloading rules.

### **SSL Certificate Distribution (Certs-Dumper)**
To allow other servers (like the NVR or NAS) to use the Let's Encrypt certificates generated by Traefik, a dumper service is used:
- **Source:** Monitors `/etc/traefik/letsencrypt/acme.json`.
- **Destination:** Extracts and dumps `.crt` and `.key` files to `/nfs/publicshare2/certs`.
- **Benefit:** Centralizes SSL management; other network nodes simply mount the NFS share to get updated certificates.

### **Additional Services**
- **Pi-hole / AdGuard Home**: Primary DNS and Ad-blocking.
- **Uptime Kuma**: Infrastructure health monitoring.
- **Watchtower**: Automated container updates.

### **Docker Compose Fragment**
- [Unifi](../infrastructure/unifi.md)
